For cold winter chills, this place has a nice rambunctious vibe to just sit and enjoy large quantities of seafood with friends and family. This Korean restaurant I believe this is the original establishment, while the other one is in Woodside. We ordered the seafood hot pot($$$), where there was a variety of steam seafood being infused by boiling broth underneath the seafood. When I said variety, I mean the cast of the Little Mermaid from, ""Under the Sea scene,"" were taken from the ocean and they are now on the table. Oh what poor unfortunate souls. The seafood was overall average, there some seafood that were overcooked and become tasteless, while other part of the seafood galore was fantastic. It was like playing heads or tails with your taste buds. However, the broth was overall my favorite part of it. With the flavors of the sea being brewed it was a symphony of the sea with every spoonful. Beside the hot pot, we also order live cut up octopus, which was an interesting situation. If you do not like squishy texture or food that fights back........please don't order it, it may not be worth the price or your mouth. As for the drinks the watermelon soju was very refreshing and made the meal very sweet. Overall, if you have a big group who are not afraid of seeing live seafood being cooked, please come and try this place out.",63,1.0,/user_details?userid=lsnImU4XHvOSRZqc11_PoQ,Philip L.

After walking around looking for a restaurant that makes bibambap. We settled for Korean BBQ and I'm already making plans on returning. One thing to know: when you get seated eggs will be made at your table as soon as you sit down. Just like other Korean spots you receive small dishes to share. The kimchi here was superb here.Maybe because it was a really busy Saturday night we did not cook the meat ourselves. But that was ok for the group I was with because we were staving. I was a bit shy but I should have asked for more. I highly recommend the short ribs. We received a small cast iron skillets containing the short ribs and sautéed onions. Yum yum! Warning: if you order the spicy marinated pork prepare to cry. It was super spicy but seasoned so well I couldn't stop eating it.

We ordered a yogurt soju and the Empire Seafood Hot Pot. The yogurt soju was good and strong. But because we didn't finish it that quickly, all the ice melted and that sucked. The banchan (side dishes) are a little lacking, but it's probably because it's a divey-like place. It was a couple of slices of cucumber & carrots with soy bean paste, steamed egg, and ddeokbokki (spicy rice cake). They also fry eggs for you in person - that was cute. The ddeokbokki was really spicy but good. Wish it had been heated up though.The hot pot was huge and looked overwhelming for three girls, but we did a fair share of damage and I'm wondering if it really would be enough for 4-6 people. Maybe if you also ordered something else, it would be enough? The waiter also cuts all the seafood and stuff for you to make the lobster/crab/squid easy to eat.It also gets REALLY salty near the end after the broth really cooks down, so that was a bummer because it was kind of inedible. We only ordered one order of rice to make the fried rice but two would have been a good amount for the 3 of us. The rice was so good - it gets really crispy on the bottom and you get to scrape it off. The hot pot was $100 in itself, so it would make more sense to go with more people. Also, go with more people because I think it would also be nice to not have JUST the hot pot to eat the entire time and be able to order other dishes. We wanted to try the pumpkin dish but it was huge and more than $30 and we knew we would just have a lot of leftovers. I honestly just want to go back and just have the rice...",81,,/user_details?userid=BzRpE01im4SxomAzSO4BCg,Jen P.

Eggs made two different ways, one like a omelet style and the other whipped with sesame oil, the whipped eggs were clutch along with the half shell oysters.

I'd like to describe it as a Korean styled izakaya spot - drinks and munchies. We used to have a Sik Gaek in my town in NJ (specifically, Fort Lee - but that's now Bada Story). This one's almost double the size of the one in Woodside but the food tastes the same. I was so sure that it would be packed at 7pm on hump day- to my pleasant surprise, the place was only 10% filled. Noice.If you want a good heart burn, make sure to order the ones that start out with the word ""spicy."" I really didn't eat much last night because I just am not the Sik Gaek type - if I want izakaya, I'm going all out Japanese tapas. It's also worn down and in dire need of a facelift. I've been to this location many years ago before I was actively Yelping, and I have to say, I felt like it needed a facelift then too! The most interesting thing about this spot? Love the cute wings and teddy bear walls on the outside. I didn't get to take a picture last night because I looked like dirt, but there will be next time - I just won't be eating there. I'll probably go to Jurang across the street instead - their food is superior in my books. I really go for the easygoing ambiance (super duper casual) and soju - LOTS OF SOJU. I've never left a Sik Gaek sober before and I don't plan on breaking that routine. The food was a bit too salty for my taste, as usual. I also just don't trust the ingredients there. I don't touch the complimentary fried eggs, spicy rice cakes or the raw veggies they give you to munch on while waiting for your dishes to arrive. From the run down look to the dusty walls with numerous photos that looked like it survived a war... meh. I've tried about 12 different dishes from the Sik Gaeks I've visited in total, and not one really stuck to me. The watermelon soju is a waste of money - the hell with that. Besides, how do I know they didn't add sugar? If they did, I'd like to know. The bathrooms are always disgusting at every Sik Gaek. Yuck. The toilet to your right when you walk into the women's restroom actually COMES OFF THE FLOOR. No joke, it'll bounce and smack you in the you know where.

I love the atmosphere, it really does have an underground, Korea feel to it and I love the old school Kpop. It's a drinking place with food, the prices are kinda high but that's what happens when you go to a popular place. In speaking of popular, Bourdain filmed a No Reservations episode here, the Flushing episode, with Chef David Chang. My table shared a yogurt soju which was OK, but super girlie. The over easy egg is good and made well but I was so confused why they served it. There was celery and cucumber with bean paste for banchan plus the over easy egg? That's it? They also give steamed egg during the meal, I was surprised they didn't give more banchan.The food:Fresh Octopus- The live octopus is kinda the big draw here. I saw Bourdain and David Chang eat it on an episode of No Reservations and I wanted to try it ever since. The idea seems rather fun, but the octopus itself, doesn't have a lot of flavor, I do however prefer the salt oil condiment over the bean paste. Also, make sure you chew thoroughly and don't be shocked when it sucks onto the inside of your cheek holding on for dear life. I thought the octopus was fun to try but it didn't have a lot of flavor and for $25 bucks it is INSANELY pricey. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Spicy mixed Seafood Chul-Pan. The pot has a nicely flavored broth that has a tiny spicy kick. The pot consists of mussels, clams, one crab, squid, rice cakes, shrimp, enoki and button mushrooms. I was pretty happy with everything. This is a large dish and is enough for four or more. yelp.com/user_local_phot… yelp.com/user_local_phot…Fried Rice With Roe and cheese- At the end of the Chul Pan, you have the option to add a fried rice to the remaining broth left in the pot, my group also added cheese, as well. I thought the rice was a nice touch, the rice absorbed a lot of the seafood broth, but my only issue was some sand from the seafood was at the bottom of the pot therefore cooked in with the rice. Overall, a nice addition to the pot. yelp.com/user_local_phot…Seafood BBQ- Small grilled assorted shellfish. Clams, prawns, mussels, stuffed clams, and stuffed clams with cheese, there was also a spicy sauce that is heated in a baby cast iron skillet that goes well with the seafood.. This dish had more noticeably fresher seafood than the Chul-Pan, the prawns were my clear winner. The clams were so fresh and had a nice briny taste to them. The mussels were so fat and meaty, the mussels were excellent. The stuffed clams were kinda weird for me since it taste like chopped clam with salad dressing. The stuffed clam with cheese was a little better because the flavor of the cheese comes through with the clam meat but the green peppers completely overwhelmed this dish.

I would recommend calling ahead on the day of if that's the reason you're going. Also, if you order the large seafood pot, you can add an order of live octopus (if in season) for, I believe it was, $10, instead of getting it a la carte for $24. Spend that $14 towards soju instead. ^^Most recently, a group of 8 of us dined here and ordered the large seafood pot - so good!

We added a couple of orders of udon noodles after devouring the seafood. We also got live octopus. (Always fun when your dining mates have never had it before. Pictures and videos ensued.)

They seated us on the right wing of the restaurant and the music was so loud, I felt like I was screaming across the very small table to talk. They eventually turned the music down upon request. As soon as you sit down, they fry eggs for you as a starter. Then they bring over rice cakes in a spicy sauce. Among the three of us, we started off with a seafood pancake. It was filled with seafood and a lot thicker than the previous ones I have had. It was also not as oily which was great. Then, we ordered the seafood hot pot which was $54.99. It came with clams, mussels, mushrooms, green bean sprouts, and a little bit of udon noodles. There are extras (seafood, noodles, vegetables) you can add on for a surcharge.

However, when I kindly asked the waiter how he was able to touch the boiling hot liquid, he ignored me..Overall, the food was great but the service, not so great.

We had to ask three different person we were ready to order, all of whom chose to tell me that they don't take orders, but yet still would not alert the person who would. The food was great though; the seafood pot is definitely a must get, but the option for adding the lobster is kind of expensive. It cost an additional 40 dollars for one, and in most places, 40 dollars for a lobster is a little over priced. You can go into a Chinese restaurant and get 2 lobsters for that price. When you finish the whole pot, you can order a la carte items to be add in, and they also refill your soup too. The portion for the a la carte items are pretty big, so don't let price dissuade you from ordering more.Lastly the live octopus is a really unique experience. The taste is refreshing as it is only octopus and sesame oil with a dip on the side, but because the octopus is still moving, the octopus legs will still wiggle around and suction on to the top of you mouth or your tongue. Definitely a special plate that you need to try albeit the taste is just so so. Overall, I took off 2 stars because of the service because in my opinion, service is very important.

I been here several times, and haven't had much to complain about but at the same time this place haven't ""Wowed"" me. Food: The thing that I love most about this restaurant is probably the Watermelon Soju. Every time I came here, I usually get the giant pot of seafood. Last time I checked, it is $100 and it is more than enough to share for 4 people. They do give some top notch seafood like abalone and many different types of clam and shellfish. They also provide fresh live octopus to cook in your pot when you order the seafood pot.I think everyone should try the live octopus (tentacles still wiggling) at least once. Be careful when you eat the live octopus because the suction cups on the arm pieces are still active when the dish is served so chew thoroughly so the suctions on the tentacles don't cling to your throat when you swallow. It is a choking hazard for people who had a little too much to drink. Usually the seafood pot is enough to keep 4 people happy and full. You can always request them to had in a packet of udon if you're craving it/hungrier than normal like we were. The service is good/responsive. They were really attentive and nice and try to accommodate as much as they possibly can. Their seafood pancake is also pretty good. I've never tried their raw oysters so I can't comment on them. I would definitely come back to this place every once in a while in the future. I would recommend giving this a try once to judge for yourself.P.S. Please keep in mind of their schedule. They are closed on Mondays. We made the mistake of trying to come here to eat one night (I'm not sure if it was Monday, but most likely it was).

The we has the thick and thin pork bbq and the rib eye bbq. I liked the thin pork better then the thick.. And it's a different xut of meat then the other places that has been round this is like bacon. The flavor of the ribeye was a salty and savory one. There of course it's a collossal seafood. Just to let you know we has 6 adults and 2 younging. 7 of us struggled to finish. It was totally worth it. The total bill with tax and tip was around 260...

(Haemul Soondubu).

We had a reservation at 7pm, but had to cancel due to trip delays. The restaurant was nice enough to accommodate us and give us priority for the next set of available seating.Due to the nature of the restaurant (taking your time to eat and drink), we ended up having to wait for an hour or so. The host felt bad that we had to wait so long, and ended up getting everyone free Coors Light. We really appreciated his sincerity and attentiveness to our needs.When we were finally seated, we ordered 2 of their spicy seafood hot pot, live octopus and watermelon soju. The watermelon soju consisted of a hallowed out watermelon filled with juice, ice and soju. It was sweet and refreshing, albeit a bit weak.The live octopus was definitely an experience, as you can feel the tentacles squirming around in your mouth still. Not for the squeamish, but an unique experience for anyone adventurous enough. It doesn't actually taste very good (a bit slimy and bland), but you're probably not doing this for taste.The seafood hot pots were huge, filled with a variety of foods like mussels, clams, lobsters, duboki (rice sticks), abalone, shrimp, etc... The hot pot wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, and the broth was overly salty at times, but the variety definitely made up for the shortcomings.The service was also fantastic, with their host checking in on us constantly to make sure we were well provided for. He also gave our table some free lychee soju, and obviously we accepted enthusiastically, because who can say no to more alcohol?Oh and while this is all happening, you can hear them blasting some dubstep, EDM and Top 40 stuff from their speakers.

Service is bad and facilities are poorly maintained. I came here on a Sunday with a couple of my friends. There were many waiters/waitresses on standby, and some were just standing by the side chatting. Right away we felt quite unwelcomed. (1st bad sign) The waitresses were not attentive as we walked in. Not only did we not get the usual cheer but we also got turned down when we requested to switch to another table with a little more seating space. This is when the place was STILL VERY EMPTY.

First thing we got was pan-fried eggs, which was not bad. In addition we got a small bowl of dukboki, 2 hot egg custard, and bland kimchi. But overall the side dishes were lacking and unmemorable. -Korean Side Dishes: Dukboki, Egg Custard(x2), Pan-fried Eggs, KimchiThen we ordered: -Raw Oysters (A dozen) -Seafood Steamed in a Pumpkin with Cheese-Spicy Dark Meat Chicken with CheeseOh God. The raw oysters was a BADDD idea. It came in a dozen, which I could normally finish half of it by myself easily. But these? No OH NOO. I have never had such bad oysters. I didn't know how in the world they can mess this one up. I highly question where Sik Gaek got their oysters, and how they are preserving them. The weird sauces that came with it did not help. The hot sauce was bland (wth) and another red sauce, which looked and tasted like bibimbap paste, was not compatible w/ the oysters. I asked for Tabasco sauce, which no one knew what I was talking about (WTH!) They simply gave me more of those weird red sauces. We weren't able to finish 12 oysters. Maybe we needed some strong liquor to down those things, though, our stomachs already gave up trying. The second thing we got was the seafood steamed over sweet Japanese squash, which they referred to as ""pumpkin"", topped with mozzarella cheese. The seafood portion mostly consisted of baby octopus and different sizes of shrimps. This was the only thing they got it right. It was decent. Not amazing. Not over powering. It was a good blend of cheese and spicy octopus along with the soft and sweet squash/pumpkin. We got the medium size but there was still alot of left over so I packed it for lunch tomorrow. SURPRISINGLY, this tasted a lot better overnight and after microwaved.Lastly we got the Spicy Dark Meat Chicken with Cheese. Skip it. It was overly spicy, salty, and super spicy, and very salty. The mixture of cheese did not help. Just listen to me and skip it.  It is unlikely that I will revisit this place. I left this place feeling unsatisfied and incredibly thirsty. I did not received good food of which I paid good money for. Moreover, I am baffled at the sheer number of 5 stars reviews (?!)

There are a lot of different fun menu items to try like the Watermelon Soju and the live squid. We, a group of 12, hit this place up on Sunday night and the tables were packed even though it was early. We ordered the grilled seafood platter combo and a seafood soup. The small eggs on the small frying pan as an appetizer was cute, but ours burned because the servers were simply inattentive. This continued to be a theme of the night, as we had to keep flipping our food with our own chopsticks to make sure they didn't burn. Our clams were not cleaned properly at all, as I chewed on stones every time I tried to eat one. I understand crunching on some sand once in a while, but the whole platter? The lobster was dried out and fishy. The only thing that felt fresh was the shrimp.  We had seafood pancake as well, which tasted much better than the grill combo or the soup. The spicy ddukbokki that came as a side dish was delicious, so I might want to actually order a full cheese ddukbokki next time, if I go again. The friend who had recommended the restaurant suggested that the samgyeopsal was actually much better for the grilling than the seafood. I took a star off for the quality of seafood, as much of it was not cleaned well and was not fresh. I took another star off for the service, which was bad despite the floor manager recognizing one person in the group as a regular customer. The atmosphere was awesome, though, and the prices were not bad.

It was only 8pm, but the place was packed and rowdy, with tons of beer on every table, dance music blasting, and everyone roaring in Korean. Way too FRAT PARTY!!!, so we left.Gave it another shot recently for the lunch specials: $6.99 all week til 2pm. Nice! The usual menu is for sharing by large groups, but the lunch specials are Korean standards in individual-friendly portions. I'd compare the variety with Assi Plaza's food court (see my review!), but with plenty more atmosphere. Want something heavily sauced, very spicy, and very hot?  Get stone pot rice. The beef bone broth is milky and flavorful. I skipped the Korean tofu stew (soondubu jjigae is my favorite!), but tasted someone else's - not bad but not the best. Comes with the raw egg cracked into it already.  The interior is big, and reminds me of a vintage izakaya (don't know anything about old Korean pubs so a comparison to an izakaya it is). The walls are covered in crinkling currency, vintage schoolbooks, old satchels and coats... a little overdone, but in this area where sleek and IKEA are more the norm, I like it. There are lots of intimate booths inside that take up more room than the tables.When you sit down, they start the fire in the table and fry up one egg per person in a completely ancient looking pan. It's a cute, simple way to do appetizers! Otherwise the banchan is limited, again, like the Assi Plaza food court - actually, I think there was only kimchi?At first I thought the tea was diluted roast corn tea, which I adore, but I think it was actually rice tea - as in the starchy, cloudy water that comes from cooking rice..Overall the food is okay and the place definitely has character. I just wish evenings weren't so forbidding because of the extreme atmosphere and screaming drunkies. I would NOT try it without a Korean friend.As for the famed ""live octopus"" .... Did you know that octopuses have the largest brains of any invertebrate? As we all know from prowling Youtube, they can unscrew the lids of jars, for god's sake!

The seafood was really fresh and good, especially if you love shellfish.

Too bad. We went on a Sunday during President's Day weekend and the place was packed, with about a 10 minute wait, I'm sure they would have sold a lot of the octopii.

But service was fast and the dish that we ordered had excellent flavor. We ordered the octopus noodle in a spicy sweet red sauce. The octopus was cut up into 1"" pieces, the noodle was a chewy udon type, and the sauce was flavorful and not overpoweringly spicy (we asked for mild). It came in a sizzling pan with large chunks of cabbage, scallions, and jalapenos. You have to continually stir it, or the noodle will stick to the pan that's on the flame. Apparently this dish doesn't normally need a flame, but the table grills are a special thing that this restaurant does.  The only ban chan we got were 2 fried eggs, steamed egg, sad cucumber & carrot chunks with a red paste, and later on seafood rice cakes in red sauce (this is was Very good also).We took the Q28 from Main St. here, it took about 15 minutes.

When it came to us, a small octopus was struggling for his life, but after a couple of minutes, it turned to a pale color and stopped moving...i felt very bad for it...but it did taste deliciousthe seafood and beef pot had tons of seafood in it, including shrimps, clams, mussels, sea snails, and lots of soy sprouts and other vegetablestasty and healthy in my opinionThe ambiance is loud and filled with young people. they play loud music and make you feel like you are eating inside a club.Expect a wait on weekends",745,2.0,/user_details?userid=u6Z1B5YdCLJHEbocIBhQwQ,Lily T.

They use different grill tops for the at-table grill depending on the style ( kalbi comes more sukiyaki style boiling in marinade, while bul-gol-gi grills directly).Lots of Korean-style extras and an order for two was way more than two normal people could eat.

Few minutes later a birthday hip-hop song and alarm type of thing blasted out of nowhere. Note to self: On my upcoming birthday, I'm celebrating here! It was packed on a weekday and I can already picture the weekend. They have HUGE seafood and non-seafood platters, hotpot, BBQ, and all your favorite Korean dishes & drinks. The staff is mighty AWESOME. While you're deciding what to order, they're already frying eggs on your table. They flipped them at the right moment and the eggs were cooked perfectly. Eating seafood can be such a hassle, but not here since the staff always appears with this sharp scissor that can perfectly cut a lobster in half or cut the abalone into the x number of pieces you want. This place is so much more worth it than seafood restaurants elsewhere, where you'll spend lots of Benjamin's. Since it's family style, people bring your crew and dig in! The portions are humongous and you get a bunch of extras on the side. There were 5 of us and we only ordered 2 items, the seafood hotpot ($99) that can feed 5 people and the watermelon soju ($30). As I've mentioned earlier, the eggs were great (they include a steamed version too!). Watermelon soju was just a bit watered down. The live octopus was a fun experience to eat. Yes it was slimy but oh so FRESH. The seafood platter is a monster. Lobster, a crawling octopus, huge clams, and a bunch of other shellfish piled on. I did not find a single bad shellfish. Underneath you'll find udon noodles, ddukboki (you get a side dish of this too), bean sprouts, napa cabbage, and a few different mushrooms floating around. It's all boiled in this mild spicy broth. TIP: Turn down the fire after cause overcooked seafood is no good. There's sauce you can dip the seafood in for that extra flavor, and buckets (very useful!) around that you can throw the empty shells in cause it piles up. Afterwards they use some of the leftover broth and make kimchi fried rice (delicious!) in front of you. At the end where everyone is all bloated they'll poured everyone a cup of cucumber juice for cleansing purposes, it was incredibly refreshing. I wouldn't mind drinking an entire bottle of it.

We went to the Manhattan Koreatown and asked around; but the Koreans there said that we had to go to the Flushing Koreatown to find this dish that I had this burning desire to try.From Manhattan we took the No. 7 to Flushing. It is the very end of the line. The station is located in the heart of Flushing, Chinatown.At street level we ask 5 people (Chinese or Korean) where Koreatown was.  Each said Koreatown was in Manhattan.  What a disappointment!We head back to Brooklyn. Gf's daughter insisted there was a Koreantown in Flushing.Two days later, we head back to Flushing. This time gf's daughter calls her friend Phillip that lives in Flushing.  Phillip said he would take us to the Flushing Koreatown.Phillip arrives: we introduce ourselves; I explain about the live baby octopus; he calls a cab; and we head on out to Koreatown.Koreantown Flushing is about 1-1/2 miles from the 7 terminal and is in an area called Auburndale.He takes us to this restaurant called Sik Gaek and we begin one of the most fascinating food experiences of our lives.The outside the restaurant is not flashy; but looks contemporary.The inside is low lit and pub-like; like a bar or restaurant you would find in the old part of any town or city.Phillip: ""What you want to order is the ""sannakji"". This place serves sannakji and the reason I brought you here is because it was featured in Anthony Bourdain's-No Reservations, when he dined with famous Korean chef David Cheung.youtube.com/watch?v=DvuD…We should also order a seafood boil. I recommend the King Crab.""The King Crab Seafood Boil was $69.99. One order! I'm thinking if this is enough for the four of us?  Maybe we should order more.The banchan here is different from where we come from (Hawaii). You get one serving of kim chee, table cooked eggs and dduk bok kie (spicy rice cake).The sannakji is delivered. The dish is very simple: Live, squirming, squiggly, baby octopus, some lettuce, chili peppers, green onions, fresh garlic, a sprinkle of sesame seeds and sesame seed oil.  I was captivated; watching the live, squirming, squiggly octopus.yelp.com/biz_photos/dP2K…I try to pickup one of the tentacles with my chopsticks; but the suckers cling to the plate.This is like a sport. You need coordination, concentration, effort to pickup the tentacles with chopsticks. There is this sense of accomplishment when you pick up the thing and put it in your mouth.  You feel it trying to suck on to your tongue, the inside of your mouth and throat.  You begin to think it is trying to suffocate you to death.  You get this heroic feeling knowing you just killed a monster before it killled you. You swallow it. There is this rush that you get when know you just killed ...Godzilla.The King Crab Seafood Boil arrives. The 3 of us that haven't had this dish are in awe.  We cannot believe our eyes. The pot is about 14"" in diameter and there is a huge, heaping pile of mussel, giant cherrystone clams, sea snails, crab and king crab. The pot and seafood comes half cooked and all the juices of the seafood seep to the bottom of the pot as it boils and continues to cook in front of us.yelp.com/biz_photos/dP2K…Our waiter came over to cut the crab into manageable pieces; but other then that, we were on our own.This pot could easy serve 6 with no problem at all.  We get to a point where we are struggling and are forcing ourselves to eat.  There were about 8 pieces of clams, mussels and snails left when Phillip calls the waiter over.Phillip: ""Now we can have the soup.  Do you like noodles?""We didn't know what was about to happen but answered ""Yes"".Phillip tells the waiter:  ""We want our soup with noodles!""The waiter takes the pot back to the kitchen and when he returns; brings a steaming hot pot with our leftover seafood; combined with leeks and udon noodle.  All the juices from the seafood is the broth in our udon soup.yelp.com/biz_photos/dP2K…With the first sip you can taste the wonderful combination of the different sea creatures that were in the boil.  This was a very delightful ending to the most wonderful food experience of our trip.I highly recommend you visiting Sik Gaek and ordering the Sannakji and Seafood Boil.P.S.

I think the hot pots are a great deal because of how large it is and you can share it - but definitely don't come here for just BBQ.Also - definitely come with at least 4-6 people or you will have a hard time finishing the hot pots!",252,1.0,/user_details?userid=v5xqmtmMEUnZaBQ3p-zQQQ,Diane L.

Their decor was friendly, energetic and casual, using benches as tables and stools. Not only was the wait staff attentive, they were extremely respectful. I walked in with my holding onto my grandmonther, and before she was ready to sit down, they bought her a chair with a back so that she can be comfortable. After much debate over all the seafood and bbq meat options there were, I solicited the help of June to help me narrow down the most recommended dishes as well as portion appropriate. He totally understood what I was trying to achieve and guided me through their extensive menu, all of which seemed enticing. 20 minutes later, June came to me and ask if grandma (whom is 90) has any allergies or food preferences, because he was unsure if the (raw) seafood food options were limiting to her diet. I replied saying she's really easy going, and she'll eat just about anything we order her. After another 10 minutes, June came back with a huge plate of king crab legs just for grandma.  He said they really respect elder Chinese grandma's and they recently had one close to their heart pass away. Meanwhile, the rest of the 10+ people in the party was having a blast, drinking soju, digging into the seafood hotpot, grilling the juicy bbq beef and squirming about eating live octopus. The place is filled with photos of people that have eaten there in the past, and had a great time - we were a recent addition.

They put a huge bucket by the floor so you can dispose of the shells.

I can honestly say I've never had a food experience like the one I had at Sik Gaek. It was the freshest seafood I've ever had~ a seafood-lover's dream! Most of the seafood is alive up until the point they cook it for you and some even arrive at the table still alive. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really fun and lively and great for big groups. Our group had...... live octopus sashimi - The octopus comes to the table still wriggling! Some pieces are even hard to pick up because the octopus tentacles suction itself to whatever it touches. If you don't chew and swallow quickly, you can even feel it suction to your teeth and cheek. Since the octopus has little taste on it's own, this dish comes with two sauces to choose from. I really liked the octopus with the sesame oil plus a slice of jalepeño. Random fact: according to our server, live octopus is an aphrodisiac for men in Korean culture. yelp.com/biz_photos/dP2K…... haemul pajeon (seafood pancake) - This is something I like to get whenever I go to a Korean restaurant. There's nothing in particular to commend or complain about here. It was good and they were generous with the seafood. Yum!yelp.com/biz_photos/dP2K…... sea urchin sashimi - They gave this to us on the house and I'm so glad they did! This was the freshest uni I've ever had. The texture was just firm enough and it pretty much melted in my mouth. The taste was delicately ocean-y without being fishy (if that makes sense). So delicious!yelp.com/biz_photos/dP2K…... dancing octopus casserole - OMG What a gigantic pot of seafood! There were lobster, crabs, abalone, small clams, giant clams (the size of a fist!), shrimp, squid, octopus, and mussels in a spicy broth with fresh veggies, mushrooms, and noodles. The lobster and the abalone were both still alive when the casserole arrived at the table. The name of the casserole comes from the two live octopus they put on top of the casserole and you watch as they cook. I admit I was slightly disturbed yet fascinated by the sight of two octopus' wriggling to escape their imminent death. After the octopus', lobster, and abalone are cooked, a server cuts them to pieces making everything ready to eat. The octopus, lobster, and abalone were some of my favorite items from the casserole because they were so fresh (obviously). I also really liked the giant clam and squid. The spicy broth was the perfect seasoning for everything. The noodles were too mushy at the end of the meal so I suggest scooping them out first.yelp.com/biz_photos/dP2K…The amount of food was perfect for our group of 6 to stuff ourselves silly.

I came in with such HIGH expectations, because Anthony Bourdain made it look sooooo goood. But eh, taste-wise, it was only ok.... kind of disappointing.Let's start off with the good stuff: experience ALONE was a total 5 OUTTA 5!! Watching tentacles squirm on my plate and the octopus crawl over my steaming wok was CURAAZY! My animalistic instincts kicked into gear, and I was going on a wild ""EAT AND DESTROY"" mode. Everything was INCREDIBLY fresh. I wish yelp would let me post videos, but you can probably see those on youtube.I got the $99 fresh octopus hotpot. It's an enormous BIG warm & spicy seafood stew that comes with two octopuses (octopussies? Octopusis? WHATEVER the plural form is...). It also has lobster, squid, shrimp, clams, mussels, crab, and a myriad of Asian vegetables. The best part was the fresh lobster and clams. They were SO fresh that the meat tasted sweet! PLEASE make sure you share this pot among at least 6 other people! I Since there wasn't enough people to share it with, I felt obliged to eat SO much seafood while it was still fresh, that I got sick. ALSO BE AWARE, Sik Gaek does NOT take off the shells off for you, nor do they take the heads off the shrimp. EVERYTHING goes into the pot. They do NOT make this place PG... the barbarianism is TOTALLY rated R. The octopus shashimi must be eaten with CAUTION. Their tentacles' suckers can STILL pinch your tongue. They even have this HUGE BUCKET for you to toss all the carcasses. Total slaughter. Honestly though, the rest of the food was only ok.... Nothing else had any flavor. All the flavor came from the soup, which was just spicy and bland. Bleh...I do recommend the Seafood pancake! Service is great, although some of the servers don't speak English very well, so it's hard to tell if they understood me. The music was AWESOME. I was almost dancing as I ate. It's pretty loud.Tip: New yorkers, this place is in the middle of NOWHERE. You'd have to take the MTA subway to the very END of the 7 and then you STILL gotta take a bus. Thus, worth the trek ONLY ONCE!Conclusion, go there with friends, get your camera, put it on video, try it, and don't come back.

The octopus itself have no flavor.  The sauces and the accompanying raw garlic and sliced chili pepper is where all the flavor come from. It's kind of interesting to have it squirm in your mouth..  Those suckers (literally) does not want to come off the plate.  I thought it was ok but not something that I will have a urge to try again and again.  Way too chewy.  I was very happy to have a chance to try it without having to go all the way to Korea though.One of my friend ordered the steamed seafood pot which is not to be confused with the boiled seafood one in spicy broth.  This one comes presteamed before it gets to your table and the only juice in the pot is what dripped from your seafood.  My friend that ordered it loved it but another friend of mine and I thought that it was too much like steamed seafood that we could order in many American establishments. How different could it taste since all they do is steam it?  The seafood was extremely fresh and there was a huge amount but steam seafood in a pot didn't taste specifically Korean to either of us.... unless you count the Korean dipping sauce. At the end when all the all the seafood was finished, they take the leftover juice at the bottom of the pot and use it to cook some noodles in it.  This came with the order.  The noodles and the broth was extremely good.  All that fresh seafood juice makes an incredibly flavorful broth.  I think it's the best part of this dish.The place was very rustic feeling and the atmosphere was pretty loud between the music and the diners talking.  Our main waitress didn't speak much English but another one did.  They were all nice and friendly and even the one that spoke only Korean tried her best to mime and draw her way through our order with a smile.  Five stars for her effort.I have to give this place a three for now but I believe it's mostly because my idiot friend ordered the wrong dish.  No more steamed seafood at this place for me because despite the freshness, it didn't feel very Korean (although I wish they would sell that excellent noodle and broth by itself).  I plan to stop by again and hopefully up the rating by at least another star by ordering the seafood selection again but this time in boiling chili broth.  Heard that one is good.",371,5.0,/user_details?userid=6I042PLRiYub7RvufcqjZQ,Wing L.

There were 8 of us and we called in advance for reservation. Unfortunately, when we got there, they told us they could not find our reservation and then 15 minutes later, they eventually found it and seated us. We wanted to try the live octopus and that was our sole purpose of hiking all the way to Flushing area. Well, it was also cuz it was my birthday and we went karaoke beforehand ;)  Anyway, back to the food. The HUGE seafood hotpot was definitely worth the $99. There's plenty of seafood in it (scallops, conch, shrimp, abalone, octopus, mussels, etc etc), along with udon and bean spreads on the bottom (which I loved as well). Additionally, it included a live octopus dish, which alone would've cost $24.99. Now, the live octopus was very interesting; after the octopus tentacles were cut into pieces and brought to us on a plate, they were still moving! Some of my friends were scared to try, but it was SOOO good! My husband and I and another couple enjoyed every bite and were pretty much fighting for the last pieces. =P The conclusion is that we would definitely go back to this place just for the live octopus!  Besides the seafood hotpot, we also had a large assortment of shellfish to grill (scallops, large clams, conch, abalone, etc). The ingredients are a kind of a repeat from the seafood pot, but instead of cooking in soup, these you can grill. On top of that, we also ordered stir-fried and spicy chicken gizzard (cuz a couple of us couldn't handle too much spicy) and both were excellent. Anyway, next time we go, we will probably skip the assortment of shellfish to grill cuz it was just too much food. But we will definitely order those large clams to grill on the side cuz they were my favorite and were so much better grilled than cooked in soup. But the seafood pot is a must. Service was very friendly as well. But be prepared for a loud background setting since it is more like a bar-theme restaurant. Overall, a great place to hang out (especially in Winter cuz it's just a bit too hot in the summer; we were all sweating like pigs by the time we finished our meal).

Last time I went, I made a mistake of ordering the baby octopus hot pot which comes already cooked- be sure to get the fresh one especially if you're going to order the live octopus. The fresh one comes with two octopus so get one of them cut up. The cost will end up being the same anyway!!If you like seafood, I suggest the steamed shellfish and grilled assorted shellfish over the hot pot. The meat dishes are pretty tasty too, although the beef short ribs stew is just okay. As for drinks, get the watermelon soju only if you're with a group of people. The alcohol content seems low but they give you a lot for the price compared to other Korean places. The bill will come out steep but you'll be splitting it with your friends so expect to spend $25-$40 depending on what you get. Korean food will always be expensive but you're also paying for the space and service so I promise that you'll leave here pleased.Don't forget to try the complementary cucumber juice before you leave!",245,2.0,/user_details?userid=977iuLgSiG85t0kK2uLA7w,Marika T.

Pojangmacha is ghetto. It's in the slums. It's dirty. But for whatever reasons, it appeals to young Korean-Americans looking to have fun.

But, when it was mentioned Tony Bourdain and David Chang had discovered San Nakji in this Flushing restaurant, I whole-heartedly accompanied my friends in making the long trek out to Queens. The first thing we ordered was to have the squid sushi style. The pale arm segments writhing back and forth, while quite fascinating, seemed more otherworldly than something one should eat. Trying to snatch one piece up with chopsticks is an intense exercise in finger strength and dexterity. The strength of the suckers of the now dead squid is surprisingly strong, and any unfortunate fish caught within a live one's tentacles surely faces certain doom. Fortunately, I'm bigger than a fish, but even the smallest section fought for its life in mouth by sticking on my tongue and the insides of my cheeks. My advice? Bite back and show it who's boss. Also, dip it in some sesame oil. We thought it was a good idea to order the huge seafood pot (cheol pan) next. (Note, I ignored the waitress' surprise that I ordered everything in Korean) Now, this dish has some hits and misses. For the novelty, ordering this is a must. Live octopus and squid are dropped into the pot right before your eyes. If you can check your compassion at the door for the next 10 minutes, you will be in for some deliciously fresh seafood. The clams and mussels come pre-cooked. While that is probably a good idea, the clams and mussels easily reach the point of being over-cooked and tough while the lobster and squid are cooking. Still worth the effort though. Oh, and wash everything down with soju. A review isn't complete with a word on service. The waiters and waitresses were pretty awesome.

They were so rude in seating the 7 of us. I ordered the live octopus - their signature dish and they said they didn't have it. WHAT???? How disappointing! Ok fine we are seated, so we order the live lobster seafood pot, ""same as octopus, but lobster instead."" BS the last time I was there we had an assortment of clams, mussels, abalone, scallops, crabs, and calamari. This time we didn't get any scallops and only plain clams, one abalone, mussels and calamari along with the lobster which they cut up in front of us with scissors. We also ordered a $24.99 dish of bbq short ribs. We got 3 thin strips of boneless short ribs that looked like philly steakbut sliced longways in half.

When I saw ""live octopus,"" I knew we had to try it, regardless of market price ($20). It's not exactly like that terrifying scene in the film, because here they serve it neatly chopped and squirming on a bed of lettuce with sliced jalapeno and garlic atop as garnish, with a spicy dipping sauce and another of sesame oil & salt. Still, the sight of the plate is arresting.It tastes as fresh as you'd imagine a wriggling octopus to be, and extremely chewy. It also feels like you've just eaten something that would make you invincible for a while in a video game...a strangely potent food.Before going invincible, we had eaten the standard starter here, three eggs fried in a small oily pan at your table stove, which your waiter starts cooking the minute you sit down. While we ate this he also brought us four enormous raw clams, juicy and delicious. After that a seafood pancake, I believe the best I've ever had, exploding with the fresh flavors of different seafood and vegetables.We followed that with the huge seafood stew. Get the spicy one, with a bubbling red broth, stacked high with lobster, crabs, clams and mussels. Inside, if you dig deep, you'll find bean sprouts, noodles, calamari, bits of fish, rice rolls, and some exciting additions like fish ovaries and seasquirts. It's safe to say I'm not a fan of the last two, but try them at least.We drank a bottle of Cham Isul during the meal, and afterward one of the waiters brought us a lovely cold cucumber drink, a sort of agua fresca Korean style. I haven't mentioned the service, but the waitstaff here are the kindest you could wish for -- everyone was courteous, smiling and eager to explain what the stranger ingredients were in the stew. And for those reviewers who say the staff speaks only limited English, any Korean who knows ""seasquirt"" could be teaching the language in my opinion.Another reason I'd bump this up to six stars if I could -- when we first arrived to the packed restaurant, someone (possibly the owner) brought a plate of freshly fried calamari for everyone in the waiting area to snack on.

There were noodles, crunchy things later identified as yams, various veggies, and the spicy, tasty chicken DOUSED with hot sauce. It just tasted hot at first, and I burned my tongue. Later, I realize.. it's not just piping hot, it's spicy hot! Aah! A good, hard burn all the way down the gullet, keeping my tummy warm last night. We also got beef fried rice, which was tasty. Something kind of bland, to keep the slow burn from overtaking my body. I normally deal with spicy quite well, but this was too much-- so we ordered mixed rice. How silly we were, to think the rice would help. Our cute/superattentive waiter brought over MORE spicy sauce, along with a pot of rice with some fixings on top. More spicy, more, more, more!! My poor mouth.To keep ourselves from going nuts from spicy overload, we finally went for a dish of the dumplings as well. They're big, FLAT and crispy! More hot sauce, as the sauce was below the dumplings, something that kind of surprised us. The insides reminded me of a spring roll, and was kind of bland, so this sweet chili sauce was appreciated.

Besides the fact that you have to take a train and a bus to get here, its not all that bad (for all you car ""less"" ppl like me). For the ppl that have cars, there's plenty of parking and they even have valet in the back of the restaurant.Here's what we got:Fried calamari - This Asian take of what I considered an Italian appetizer is overall much softer and less greasy, but not as bold in flavorsSeafood casserole pot - A pretty looking dish (or pot), with tons of clams (nearly the size of baseballs) and mussels top off with 2 crabs and a whole lobster in a pot. But as for taste, the natural flavors of the shellfishes are muted by the spiciness of the broth and the textures of meat are ruined by being overcookedRaw platter - Unlike your standard raw bar platter, this platter is actually for grilling. You have the giant clams and mussels like the casserole pot, but they also have other items like conch. I think this was the best dish. All the natural flavors of the shellfishes are cooked in its own liquid. The only problem is while no one really mind eating undercooked clams, they do not feel the same way for mussels so we ended up overcooking them.Live Octopus - ""Its Alive!!!"" What more can I say? Actually a lot more. They are chopped into inch long pieces so they squirm around more like earthworms than Octopii. There's actually a video of me popping one of those suckers in my mouth (too bad Yelp doesn't support video). Chewy, delicious, and more interesting than the cooked version. I don't recommend putting a bunch of them in your mouth at once unless you really have a death wish (the suction cups on the tentacles will grip on to your throat). The chopped up head doesn't move like the tentacles and its much harder to swallow than the tentacles. You can also torture it like your own science experiment by tossing it in the grill, but I prefer it squirming.Spicy seafood w/ Mozzarella cheese - We were all but full, but decided to add this dish. After thoroughly mixing the cheese with the spicy pepper paste that the seafood (mostly cooked squid) is drowning in, you get a gooey and delicious dish that really fills you up if you are still hungry. It was just a bit too spicy for me.They gave us a shot of cucumber juice at the end.

The ginormous hot pot starts cooking and the octopus is still moving of course. They said start on the outside with the clams and mussels and then the beef. They come and cut up the octopus after a few minutes of cooking so it cooks thoroughly some more. In the hot pot is a lot of veggies too, including cabbage and a lot of bean sprouts! There was just way too much bean sprouts and in a way it was unnecessary. In the hot pot was also udon noodles, and we were glad that was in the hot pot so we can have the seafood and beef with it. However, there was a lot of seafood and they give us very little beef so we were disappointed. In the picture, there seemed to be a lot more beef than they gave us. The hot pot was way too big for us and it was for about $75. We asked if it's normally for two people and the guy said no, usually more for 4 people! Hahaha! We got ourselves in some trouble because we knew we weren't going to finish our food! Anyways, we did the best we could with the seafood.

My family and I went out for dinner at Sik Gaek Chun Ha, a Korean BBQ & seafood restaurant in Flushing. It was bitter cold - the perfect weather for hot pot! The restaurant is located near where Northern Blvd intersects with Crocheron Avenue. Driving down Northern Blvd, I didn't realize just how big Koreatown is - it puts the Manhattan enclave to shame, and even overshadows both NY Chinatowns (Manhattan and Flushing). The restaurant is known for ridiculously long lines, so they made a smart move by installing partitions outside to protect people against the weather. Luckily, we made reservations for 6pm - the restaurant was virtually empty when we arrived! It starts to fill up around 6:15pm, just in case you were interested.We started off with some fried eggs. Complimentary, I guess. There were also raw carrots and cucumbers on the side, with tangy red dip. Infinitely superior to the ranch dressing that's normally served with crudites! They also gave us some scrambled eggs, which came in handy to balance out the spicy food later.We ordered a seafood pancake, a platter of raw clams, grilled seafood, the popular boiling spicy hotpot, spicy rice cakes, and, of course, raw octopus! My uncle also recommended that we get the watermelon drink with soju (Korean vodka). The first round of it was pretty strong; I guess all the alcohol was on top. But as you dig deeper into the watermelon, there's more juice.We ordered so much food that the restaurant gave us uni (sea urchin) on the house! Free food is awesome; free food that's supposed to be expensive is even better!The raw octopus was delicious and, surprisingly, not slimy. The trick is to bite into it right when you put it in your mouth. Although, it is pretty cool to let the tentacles stick to the roof of your mouth before devouring them. It's served with two different sauces - sesame oil with pepper, and a catsup with some spice. I prefer the peppery oil, especially since we had other spicy foods to eat.The seafood pancake was nice and crispy. The raw clams platter was very fresh, but I think it was a bit too much food. Even with 6 adults, we couldn't finish everything. Plus, the grilled seafood platter already had cherrystone clams, along with razor clams, mussels, conch, abalone, and scallops. They bring the seafood out on ice, and you grill it yourself. It comes with a small metal bowl of spicy red broth, but again, not my favorite since we had other spicy food. For me, spicy food is enjoyable when there's not too much of it. I also think the grilled platter could do without the razor clams. The shells are too thin and brittle that they'll burn and break apart on the grill. Tiny little burnt shell pieces will wind up on the clam meat.The star of the night, though, was the boiling spicy hot pot. Clams, mussels, shrimp, crabs, and baby octopi topped with live lobster (tho the head was unceremoniously separated from the tail), and two live octopi. They call it ""dancing octopus."" The waiter places the octopi on top of the pot at your table, and you can spend your time watching them boil to death, along with the lobster.The waiter then comes back to snip off the tentacles and break open the lobster tail. Time to feast!I was lucky enough to grab a female crab from the pot, full of delicious orange roe! Mmm...crab eggs!I wish the hot pot had more noodles. Instead of covering the whole bottom, the noodles were relegated to only 1/4 of the pot. We need something to balance all that seafood meat! And I would recommend ""washing"" the spicy rice cakes off in the broth. They'll still retain some spicy flavor, but eating the rice cake when it's completely coated with that thick red sauce is way too much!Okay, so I've been raving about all the food, but what about the atmosphere? If you're lucky enough to make a reservation, you'll sit on a wooden bench. But most seating is done on small stools. Also, they don't serve hot tea. Not that you'd want hot tea with hot pot, but that's my mom for you. . . There's nothing fancy about the decor: plastic buckets for your discarded shells, a wall of old dollar bills, sojo advertisements with hot Asian girls. I'm no expert on Korean culture, but this place seems pretty authentic. The menu is in Korean and Chinese; no English save ""Lobster Snow Crab"" and ""Kimchi."" But the waiters do speak English; they'll translate the menu for you, and are very friendly. The place is virtually devoid of hipsters (can't say the same of Little Tokyo) and Americans (there was only one white guy, accompanied by three other Asian people at a table).

It's really easy to see why this place is so crowded, the sheer entertainment value of this place goes beyond any other restaurant I have been in before, and this is solely based on the food they serve. The food is very affordable compared to other korean places, and its a great down to earth atmosphere. Like what they featured on the show, it seems like the main draw of this place seems to be their giant seafood pot. When you order this dish, more likely than not someone at your table will be in awe the entire time the pot is cooking. There's just something about watching shell fish die a slow death that makes you want to sit back and enjoy every minute of it(or maybe that was just me). Anyway, it takes a couple of minutes for everything to finish cooking, including the live squid that is sprinkled on top of everything near the end. At this point, my mouth is watering and I can't wait to jump in and devour this massive bowl meant for four. Sadly the experience really goes south from there. The whole dish falls flat is so many ways. Considering how fresh the seafood is, the texture and taste is surprisingly sub par. The reason being is because of the way it is prepared. Being cooked in a giant pot along with a heavy salt broth turns this dish into a giant mess. Some items become overcooked while others need to be left in the pot for longer. The items left inside the pot become way too salty and sometimes not consumable at all. Being such a huge seafood lover, I felt that there is so much potential for this dish, but overall, the execution is missing. Some other notes: The seafood pancake was good, and the live squid sashimi is definitely worth trying if you've never had it. But like the seafood bowl, there really isnt any flavor to the squid. However they do serve it with 2 types of sauces that make up for it. This place is worth it for curious first timers.",29,1.0,/user_details?userid=fGQaHraQVO5_4Y8zYd_6cw,Mike D.

Anyway, the food wasn't great.  We started with rice cakes and strips of bean curd in a sweet tomato sc very reminiscent of Chef Boyardee's.  Yes, that sweet and that canned.  Maybe one of the worst dishes I've ever had in a Korean restaurant.  Than, inspired somewhat by the Bourdain episode, we shared the seafood hot pot with short ribs.   This included mussels, snail, squid, shrimp, razor clams, cherry stones, conch and octopus, udon, cabbage, sprouts and othr stuff I can't recall.  They put the signature just killed squid on top to squirm around but ours seem to be dead for minutes as it was barely moving.   The mussels (that opened), clams and freshly killed octopus were good, esp the razors but the conch was tough, the shrimp grainy as if poorly defrosted and the broth was pretty bland.   We had to add several condiments, miso paste, hot sauce, soy (whatever they had) to get a decent flavor. The shocker of this dish was the curled thin stips of short ribs sitting atop the pot.  They were completely frozen.  Maybe this is normal as in they cook into the hotpot from this state but I've never seen anything this either here or in Korea.   Once cooked it was  bland and not of particularly good quality.  I'll say the staff is super friendly, accommodating and efficient.  No issues there.  I wanted to love this place.  I mean it can be fun for what it is but if you want good Korean food with fresh seafood it's not the place.   Oh and did I mention my wife got violently ill when we got home?  I'm not going to claim food poisoning because the rest of us were ok.  We think maybe she got a bad mussel which can happen......But still.",35,,/user_details?userid=VWxYwYhgwPz-rZXPgxBxOw,P C.

My friend ordered the wonton wrapper like flat noodle and it was very good. We also got the grilled version of the seafood casserole, which you grill on the table yourself. I've only had grilled shellfish one other time, which was in Thailand. To put fresh shellfish on a grill for it to become dry and char-coaled does not make sense and this is the last time I will do it again. Also, it took too long to cook. We wind up asking the waiter to steam the remainder. These are HUGE portions so we only added another cooked dish, which is octopus (calamari) and pumpkin cooked in a spicy korean sauce where they bake it with mozzarella cheese on top. Sorta of like Korean fushion. The idea might not sound too appealing but it was very yummy. The sauce was not super spicy and the cheese balanced out the flavors. I wish I knew the name of it but since I didn't order it, I have no idea what it was called. How do you go to a Korean place without having liquor.

I had brought some friends with me a few years ago and they loved the food! They came back to visit me in Astoria, today, Sunday, except this time, with their two little girls and they insisted on going back to Leng's because they loved the food the first time around so much! I really should have read the reviews on Yelp before coming, because the service was just unbelievably and shockingly terrible!!!We got a nasty attitude from this one waiter (who wasn't even our waiter) because we had 2 kids with us. Mind you, these kids are well behaved, they weren't screaming or running around all over the place, or crying or anything - not that that should have been a huge problem, but I am writing this to make a point. We were seated towards the front of the restaurant where customers walk in - my friend was feeding the 1 year old and had pushed her seat back just a little bit to accommodate the baby - this jerk of a waiter (his name is SIMON fyi) came over and asked her to move her chair in because their customers didn't have enough room to walk in - mind you, the restaurant was COMPLETELY empty at this point, so I don't know what the heck he was talking about. Anyhow, we obliged.Then, the older girl was eating her soup and the soup spoon slipped out of her hands and fell under the table - I asked for another spoon, which they casually stretched and handed over and then made us move so they could find the spoon that had fallen on the floor (as if we're going to steal a plastic soup spoon - kidding?!).Keep on reading... because this isn't all..An older couple came into the restaurant and the younger girl was standing somewhat in their way - but the lady just gave a big smile (like you would to a little girl in a cute dress) and was about to walk around the girl. The super rude waiter comes over and says you need to control your children - in a SUPER loud and angry voice. My friend responded with ""it doesn't seem like your customers have a problem with it"" - the waiter then came back and said ""this is not your house, this is my restaurant"", my friend then politely said ""you could have seated us further in the back when you saw we had two kids with us"", then the waiter said, ""you can move now"" - we had already FINISHED our meal. We just asked for the check and paid in full. I at that point went over to him and asked for his name and then said ""don't you feel like there is a problem with the way you're treating us - your customers?"" and he responded with ""No, I'm not wrong, you're wrong, you need to get out of my restaurant"" - WHAAAAT?At this point my girlfriend nearly lost it and was so mad that she picked up a plate and it looked like she was going to throw it - but she didn't, she set it down on the counter - she just reiterated that we're being treated like crap because we're with a couple of kids and if they didn't want kids in the restaurant, they should have told us in the beginning and we wouldn't have stayed. At this point, this waiter nearly LUNGED at her - and it looked like he was going to hit her!!! He was literally standing over her - this is a 5'0 100lb woman being threatened by a huge waiter.Then her husband (my other friend) told Simon that he better not disrespect a woman and he DARE NOT raise his hand on his wife. Then the waiter, got in my friend's face and almost was blocking him and saying ""oh yeah? What are you going to do?"" - it honestly looked like he was going to PUNCH my friend in his face. He calmly responded with, ""with this attitude you won't have any customers left"" and this waiter said, ""We don't need your business, we have many customers!""Mind you, none of the other waiters did or said anything! Clearly this guy is a bully at work - perhaps he is the owner's son?? (How else is he still working here?) Also, the two little girls were just quietly watching the whole thing go down - it was just unbelievable. We just left in COMPLETE SHOCK at the attitude of this person. I read another review that said that this same waiter locked a lady in the restaurant till she paid for a dish that they didn't end up eating- that is PURE HARASSMENT- just like that review, we really should have called the police, because it was a completely hostile and threatening situation.Of course tomorrow I'm going to call and speak with the owner - I am amazed that this person is being allowed to continue to work here. Before long, they'll have a lawsuit on their hands because this jerk off doesn't have any self-control.PS: the food was good, but that is completely irrelevant. Sripraphai, which is a short ride away has the best Thai food in New York and there is absolutely no fear of being threatened by a burly, rude waiter.",25,5.0,/user_details?userid=xBhH_AOr5lLtPlk-ZS3rEw,Divya A.

And he walks us passed the entire first- totally empty- part and into the very back and sits us down by glass sliding doors that lead to a court yard. I was a little annoyed by that. I guess he put us back there because it was his section to serve but when the entire front of the place is completely empty- why did you take us all the way to the back dude? I also didn't like this seat in particular because it was cold out and I could feel the air coming through the glass doors. But whatever.

I wish I woulda gotten my own instead lol Also a salad came with my lunch and I gotta say- I love peanut dressing! Salad was so simple but so good! My main plate was the ""jap chae"" which was Korean beef with vegetables, noodles and soy sauce and it was very good! The only thing I was disappointed with and its my fault for not asking, but the noodles in that were those clear slimey ones? And I wasn't liking that texture in my mouth. Please refrain from jokes people! LoL So it kinda was a downer for me. I didn't finish it- I ate as much as I could. Had the noodles been different- I would have loved it!

One of the cool things about this place is that there are three sections: front of the house which is great for just about anyone, the middle room which is nice for a romantic date, and the outdoor space that's only open in the warm weather. Date night, family night, casual lazy summer evening. This place can do it all.

My wife and I were looking for a place to eat on Bway and after walking by a few places we saw this place. She had been there before for dinner and had a good experience so we said let's do it.We asked to sit in the backyard, which was lovely(The only lovely thing about that place) and were greeted by our server less than a minute after we sat down asking if we wanted something to drink or an appetizer. We didn't even have a chance to look at the menu so we just said to bring us some water.  We looked at the menu and they had some interesting and different specials on there so we said we would get an appetizer and main from the specials and a noodle dish from the rice & noodle menu.  We ordered the appetizer from the menu (PEAUK TODD)which said it was a taro root pancake and what we got back was this huge order of deep fried taro balls that had way too much grease and oil.  We chalked it up to a poorly described appetizer. We peeled off the fried mess to get to the inside and the taro root was average.  When the server came to collect our plates we told him it was way to greasy and he just kind of shrugged his shoulders.  When the mains came out my wife got that noodle dish which looked more like a Fettuccine Alfredo than anything Thai. She ordered the (Kanom Jeen Gang Keow.. .Somen noodles, chicken, bamboo shoot, eggplant and basil leaves in a Green coconut curry).  We love green coconut curry and noodles so this seemed like the perfect combo.  Unfortunately it wasn't.  The noodles were so overcooked that they were disintegrating, the curry lacked seasoning and the chicken looked so disgusting that we didn't even try it..  I ordered the KUA KLING MHOO (An authentic spicy southern Thailand dish. Pork, Thai eggplant, string beans and Kaffir lime leaf in a Very spicy chili Turmeric paste.) The server said it would be very spicy and we said OK.  This dish actually tasted better from the seasoning side but was way too spicy and I love spicy food. On the scale from 1-10 it was a 10 on the spicy side so much so that 20 minutes later I could still feel the burning sensation around my lips.Anyhow, when the server came back we complained about the noodles.  We said they were overcooked and if there was something that he could do.  He said ""No, this is how it is done!""  We said ok, is there something else we could order. He then threw a fit.  ""No, This is what you must eat. I wish you would've said something before you order because I would've told you this is how it is.  Our Food is Perfect (raising his voice) If you don't like it, it's not my problem."" He didn't offer to give us something else or to have the chef make another version of it.  My wife then asked him to please stops shouting at us.  He said ""Fine, if you don't want to eat it, I'll take it away"" and he stormed off. After that we were completely turned off and didn't want to be in there any longer than we had too.  We ate a few more bites of the spicy dish and asked for the bill.  After his fit, we didn't want to eat anything else that this server had to offer. He had no customer service skills and a really bad attitude, straight out of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares.  Leng needs to address these issues or else there will be a for lease sign on the door because people will not take that kind of service.If I could give this place 0 Stars I would.",2,2.0,/user_details?userid=_4hBNW4Q7h6R8RVrCnioTg,Michael K.

I kept ordering in and never really ate inside. But the moment I actually ate inside I was delighted by the nice decor and amazing back patio. So the ambiance for the restaurant is pretty and would make a good date place. It's fairly dim-lit at night. So other than the ambiance of the actual restaurant, what makes this place different from the plethora of Thai restaurants in Astoria is their menu. In addition to the Thai food they randomly have a few Korean dishes on the menu such as Jap Chae and Bul Go Gui. And to be honest for someone that has Korean food from Koreatown, various Korean places in Queens (including Flushing) and even Los Angeles Koreatown they're not so bad.On to the Thai food. The Pad Thai, Kha Mhoo Tod, Gai Pad Med Mamuang Krai, Khao Soi, and Nuea Kra Prow tasted great. One of my favorites is the Ped Krob (Crispy Boneless Duck Glazed with Soy Ginger). The duck is absolutely delicious and greasy. Yes, duck is greasy in general. And the skin is incredibly crispy. What also makes the dishes great is that the portions are large. So you're getting what you paid for at Leng Thai.But what has brought this place down for me from time to time is the service. There have been times where I've asked for a tweak in a menu item and the server would literally not budge. I can understand that maybe the restaurant is strict, but not being able to change a free brunch alcoholic drink for something like Thai Iced Tea is kind of silly. Or adding ice cream or something to a dessert is too much? This in particular has only happened with one server (three times).And like a previous review stated, there are times where the server(s) just didn't seem polite. Just dropping off the food like ""here, eat"" is kind of obnoxious. But this has been a rare occasion.So overall, I like Leng Thai as a restaurant - and especially in Astoria. I've been almost all of the different Thai restaurants in Astoria (and there's a ton of them) and this has been the best spot for an overall experience (ambiance, menu, cost vs. portion).",76,1.0,/user_details?userid=OkPyNb8kLZtlobKhb2-MDw,Clyde Erwin B.

I walked in the other night with pretty high expectations, considering the 4 star rating with over 200 reviews.  Pretty decor, I really liked the hanging lamps in the back, the outdoor patio and the seating arrangements. But alas, my expectations were not met.They served us complimentary appetizers, which was nice. It was spicy rice crispies in the dish used to serve dumplings, it was creatively presented and looked pretty interesting. It was a little spicy and the kick got me excited for dinner. If a free appetizer could be this good, I'm sure the entrees would be good too.I studied their menu carefully, noticing the different dishes served. There were a lot of oriental dishes I've never heard of and at the same time, there were Korean dishes. Interesting. After going over the menu a couple of times, I decided to get the Talay Gang Daeng ($19) which was a combination of jumbo shrimps, squid, mussels, scallops, fish balls and different veggies in red coconut curry and it came with a side of jasmine rice. Sounds good, right? That's what I thought too.When my food came, it was served in a pretty huge platter, it looked pretty enticing, except for when I started mixing the seafood. I then noticed that there was only 3pcs of each seafood type I enumerated above. For $19, I got 3pcs of jumbo shrimp, 3 mussels, 3 scallops, 3 tiny pcs of squid and NO fish ball. My food was just that and all sorts of vegetables. String beans, carrots, ginger and basil. I was disappointed coz I was looking forward to a seafood fest, not a vegetable fest. Oh, did I mention that I had to drown the seafood in the curry sauce for it to have even the tiniest bit of flavoring? I guess I'll have to search for another good Thai place in the area since this place couldn't deliver what I was looking for. I'm not sure if I'd give the place another chance. With the long list of places to try in Astoria, it might take decades before I give this place another try.Before I end my review, they forgot our beers and took forever to refill our glasses of water.

I don't get how this place has such great reviews. Maybe the incestual Astoria crowd needs to step into other parts of NY or even the world once in a while and realize that there's better stuff out there. This place is hardly the pinnacle of thai food in NYC and yet somehow maintains a 4 star rating.Their food isn't great, it's not terrible either, and at the same time, it's not exactly regular Thai food. I have had enough green curry in my life, in multiple cities in multiple countries, including Thailand to know that you don't make it with 2lbs of noodles. It was average at best and ended up leaving the entire heaping serving of noodles. Leng Thai has a nice outdoor area and that automatically earns them huge points in the eyes of hipsters and Astoria aficionados, since there is something inexplicably fascinating to some people about eating outdoors. Upon closer inspection, the area is claustrophobic, the chairs are difficult to scoot in and out, and if you're wearing flip flops, watch out, because some of them have a crossbar that can scrape you pretty bad. A few of the tables are crammed right up against the glass portion of the adjacent wall which because of its view of the entire outdoor area the wait staff uses to continually assess how things are going. This results in people coming and standing right next to your table, but behind the glass and looking out over you. It's pretty freakin weird, but you get used to it after the tenth time or so.On one hand, Leng Thai has a dimly lit interior and dark, royal accents to their decor and seating, creating a high-end or romantic-looking atmosphere. They decided to mix this with a wait staff that dresses in cargo shorts and tie-dye shirts. You have no clue who works there and who is dining there until they actually come up to your table. Top this off with torn, crumbled and food-stained covered menus, and ladies and gentlemen, you have Leng Thai.Everything is decently priced and they serve up pretty good portions, so it's not all bad.

Astoria is not the best place for Asian fusion, but rather for Greek and American food, so I barely get any sushi, Chinese (hardly), no Korean, or even Thai. I decided to just give this place a shot since I was striving badly for Thai nearby. Luckily I found Leng Thai because this place is absolutely gorgeous inside.From the outside, it looks dull, dark and you never know what's behind all the darkness but go in...if you're not afraid of the dark. Very modern decor and has a warm ambiance, except the waiters who wear plaid shorts and tacky blue t-shirts and make me feel like I'm dining at a boardwalk or some bar in Hawaii. We got a complimentary sweet fried noodles, which I wasn't a fan of since it was too sugary. I ordered the Pad Thai. VERY large portion so it's worth every cent of that $10.

We asked if we could be seated outside because it was such a gorgeous night but the wait was going to be about 20 minutes. After being seated at our table and reviewing the menu, the waiter came over and told us that a table outside opened up and if we wanted it, it was ours. We'll you don't have to tell us twice, we grabbed our bags and made a move for it. The outdoor patio was really very pretty and I felt very zen just sitting out there. The bamboo against the back wooden wall made the atmosphere very relaxing as if I was away on an oasis. We both just ended up ordering pad thai with shrimp. But first they brought out a complimentary bowl of sticky noodles. It was like the noodles had been boiled for a second but were still somewhat hard. They were sticky and covered in what tasted like caramel. Both my friend and I agreed that it reminded of us caramel popcorn. While it probably wasn't the healthiest thing, they certainly were delicious and it wasn't a huge serving either. Pad thai is a staple at places like this and cannot be messed up. I was very pleased with my dish, along with the generous portion! I had enough to take home for the lunch the next day. The service was attentive.

The dipping sauce was good and the julienned veggies as garnish were crunchy and tasty.Now I love spicy food. I have endured death phaal at Brick Lane Curry House, and jungle curry from a number of Thai restaurants. I seek out spicy food wherever I go. I'm addicted to it.So, I ordered the papaya salad ""regular spicy"", having had past experience with ""Thai spicy"", which I already know is beyond my ability no matter how hard I've tried. Unfortunately, this salad must've been made ""Thai spicy"", as it was inedible after a few bites. The cook didn't read the order apparently. A shame, because it was great flavor-wise. The grape tomatoes were a little mushy but not a huge concern. I called to inform them that they made it too spicy and they humored me by sending a replacement with the spice mix on the side, which was fine. I combined the two salads, and it was still at the top level of my capsaicin tolerance but certainly edible.The kimchi was acceptable. I tasted some of it and put the rest in the fridge for later.I think I'll stick with Thai Pavilion at this point.

From the outside, Leng looks like any typical restaurant, with a front waiting section, bar, and seating area. However once inside, you discover this is not the case. The waiting area consists of a bench and a side table piled with the latest magazines, and a full bar lined with stools. As you walk further into the restaurant, tables line one of the walls, facing a semi open kitchen. My friend and I were ready to sit down on one of these tables until we realized there was a back room full of more tables. Walking deeper inside, we came to this beautifully decorated back room, which had an entire glass wall facing a large courtyard and impressively tall bamboo garden, which is open and alive during the warmer months.For our visit, my friend and I started with the Chicken Thai Satay, and moved on to the Gai Pad Med Mamuang and Bul Go Gui, with the Fried Banana for dessert. Shortly after ordering, a complimentary dish of sweet fried noodles arrived on our table in a bamboo steamer. The dish was tasty, sweet, and sticky with a subtle spicy kick. It reminded my friend of kettle corn, and reminded me of a Rice Krispies treat; regardless of the comparisons, it was a fun and light way to start our meals.Service is speedy at Leng - we were still finishing up our Satay when our entrees came out. The menu said the Gai Pad Med consists of chicken sautéed with cashews, onions, scallions, and dried chili, however upon receiving my dish, I found it overflowing with many more vegetables, including mushrooms, green peppers, and celery. The portions are quite generous, and each entrée comes with a side of Jasmine rice.

A bunch of friends and I were having a mini high school reunion and one of our resident food connoisseurs recommended this for our dinner option. Obviously, I will never be one to say no to Thai. And that too, I hold my friend in high esteem for his food choices, so I was down to try anything he said was good.We were seated in the courtyard, at night-time, and it was absolutely GORGEOUS. There were stringed white lights all over, there was greenery, there was a humid but amazonian vibe. (not too warm, not too cold, just perfect). It FELT like we were in a Thai jungle. It was AWESOME. Best decor I've ever seen. So right off the bat, this felt like a win.And then I ordered the soup.OH MY GOD. OH MY GOD. OH MYYYYYY GOOOOOOD. Absolutely positively the BEST Tom Yum Gung soup I have ever had. (I have had 273 Tom Yum Gung soups in my 19 years of living). This hit the spot, in every way, and I would schlep to Astoria just for that soup. (That says a lot, because I hate trekking to Astoria). Wow, just wow. Perfectly spicy, perfectly soupy, perfectly herbed, perfectly lemongrass-ed, the typical quantity of shrimp (like 1-3 big ones), but WHATEVER THE BROTH IS SO WORTH IT. Oh man, please go here, and please order this soup.My entree didn't compare to the soup, hence the one star off. I got some version of Pad Prik Khing with Chicken (it was called something different here, but it's something that's described as a concoction with chilli paste and string beans). I asked for it extra spicy, and they made it just that spicy (which totally is NOT my complaint). My complaint is that the spice didn't come with any FLAVOR. It was just a burning in my mouth but no SSSSSSS (I can't put this into words but it's that feeling that makes you want to smack your lips together. It's basically the flavorful aspect of a spicy dish that makes the runny nose and teary eyes and swollen lips worth it). My other friend's dishes were so good though. I think I'm going to go for the Pad Thai next time. I tried a bit and it was excellent. Also, the Jungle Curry looked amazing - when they served it to my friends, it came in this steaming little pot. I tried a little, definitely crazy spicy. All in all, I am regretful I didn't try another option as opposed to the one I got, but Leng's is an awesome place when you know just what to get and don't get sucked into the myriad of choices.Also, their complimentary appetizer crunchy noodles with sweet sauce were a good buffer to the extreme levels of spice I was suffering through. Nice touch.Final Judgment: Go here, get a staple dish like Pad Thai or Basil Chicken. DEFINITELY the Tom Yum Gung soup. The entrees are a tad expensive, but the portion you get is equivalent to TWO meals, so think about the price you're paying divided in half. The ambiance in that stunning courtyard alone is worth every last penny. The service is good  and attentive. Mojitos are good. Appetizers are yummy.

There is no NYC-Chinese-Style-choose-your-meat-with-sauce-on-rice type of menu, and I find that refreshing.

Wonderful ambiance. Delightful garden seating, too. This is a BIG deal in this neighborhood! We're low on good design and charm. Always have been. For this reason alone I'd give the place five stars. All this and a wine list, too.Since my taste buds don't register Leng as a Thai restaurant necessarily, I don't order Thai standbys there.  I've never had the Pad Thai (hubby gets it, says it's great. It's HUGE.) or the Pad Se Ew or even a curry. I choose to either graze on a collection of small plates (shrimp rolls, grilled meats, grilled veggies etc.) or order an off-menu special. I once had a braised pork shank-thing that was beyond the beyond. Huge and flavorful. I always get the roti. Not remotely Thai, but totally yummy. When I feel a cold coming on, I go for the Tom Kha Gai. It always makes me feel better.If you want green curry chicken, go elsewhere. I suggest Thai Pavillion.

Any place that has Beerlao on the menu would have to screw up royally to get anything less than five stars from me. When I was in Laos (look it up), I fell in love with this amazing, phenomenal beer. And the fact that it is slowly spreading its joy through the states makes me ecstatic. So its worth noting that even without the planet's best beer on their menu*, Leng would easily rank a five star review. Their comprehensive menu covers all the necessary bases, but goes so far beyond that that it makes it almost impossible to navigate all the choices available to you. They have some really creative sounding dishes that I can't wait to dig into soon. But I stuck to my taurian rut, and went with my Thai standby of Pad See Ew, and was not disappointed. And the portions are GIGANTIC. An appetizer of Chicken Satay, and some cucumber salad started the meal off nicely as well. I tried some of my dining compatriot's dishes as well - a chicken curry and another, spicier chicken dish. Both great. That said, my See Ew owned both of them. I've gushed for so long, and I haven't even hit on the second biggest selling point here (after the Beerlao of course). The place is simply gorgeous. The interiors are classy to the max, and if you hit Leng in the summer or spring, you'll be treated to their breathtaking backyard garden. Instead of trying to describe it, I'm going to implore you to just go and check it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed.

Despite living in Astoria for 2 years, practically around the corner from this place, I had never even realized that it existed.

The next night I went with a friend, and after initially freaking out because there were no people in the front of the restaurant, we ended up in the back with a few other people. It was dark and quiet, and the space is beautiful. Can't wait to try sitting in their garden in the summer. I appreciated the free crispy noodle things. We also had spring rolls, which were pretty good, and #48 on the menu (forget what it's called), a hot and sour seafood soup that was delicious and more than big enough for both of us. We also got a pitcher of red sangria, which I enjoyed because of all of the very fresh fruit in it (beware, though: if you're sensitive to sweet things, you might want to try it first, because it's made with plum wine. It worked well with the spicy food, though). Our total ended up being about $46, mostly due to the $25 pitcher.

12668,307,1.0,1/2/2009,,5,1.0,"Brooklyn, NY",Leng Thai,7189567117,1.0 star rating,"I tried Leng probably around the first month it was open after reading such high reviews about it. My ""go to"" place is usually Benjamas, I have found they have the most authentic Thai in the area, I have tried pretty much all the Thai places in Astoria. I used to live in Astoria for about 2 years  and moved from a city with a HUGE population of Thai. I am of Asian decent myself and my best friends growing up were all Thai. So I guess I have to warn you that I am a bit pickier then most when it comes to Asian food, especially Thai food. First I'll say what I did like about Leng. I found that it had great ambiance, I love how it's decored. At first I even thought that it was cool to have the kitchen in the dining room, but about 1/2 way through the meal I started to dislike it a bit. The reason being is mainly the noise, all of the cooking was a bit noisy, maybe it was because i was sitting directly in front of where the chef was stir frying? Also, even with the ventilation they had, I could smell just about every dish they were making back their which was a bit distracting. The atmosphere is great but it's probably the only thing I liked about Leng besides the service (my waiter was really friendly and prompt). I have to say that Leng's shouldn't have ""authentic Thai"" in their title. Nothing I tasted was Authentic Thai. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. I just felt it wasn't as authentic as I like Thai food to be. It tasted more like ""Americanized Thai"", or even Chinese food to me which makes sense since their menu seems to be more of an Asian Thai ""Fusion"". The thing that pretty much sealed it's fate in my mind in terms of the food was the papaya salad and the sticky rice. The papaya salad wasn't spicy at all and it really should be at least a little bit. I couldn't even taste the fish sauce in it (fish sauce is the most important ingredient in papaya salad next to the actual papaya!). The sticky rice was NOT sticky rice. The point to sticky rice is that you eat it with your hands, it's supposed to be sticky, but firm enough to form into a ball so you can dip it in your food, it's a finger food. Leng's sticky rice was nothing more then jasmine rice that was cooked using too much water. It's pretty hard to mess up papaya salad and sticky rice, even I can make them. Maybe I went on an off day I don't know ???? Both are Thai staples that you will find served daily with meals in ANY Thai home, so the fact that both were done so poorly makes me not want to go back. I will give it stars for service and atmosphere. The menu was big also which is a plus, but if I want ""authentic Thai cuisine"" I will stick to Benjamas.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE: I have taken away yet another star....Despite my warnings, I got talked into trying it again by a friend...It was late on a Friday night and they were one of the only places still open after 11pm and she hadn't tried it yet. I forgot the name of what I ended up ordering (yes it was that unmemorable), it was supposed to be a sliced chicken breast with some sort of sauce on top. The only part of the meal that WAS memorable (not in a good way) was the fact that there was so much water on the plate that I had to drain it into my glass of water before I could even attempt to eat.... It turns out that instead of grilling the chicken, or even pan frying it, they boiled it and obviously didn't properly drain the water (hence the lake of water on my plate). The water ended up just diluting any sauce on the chicken, which in turn made it taste like boiled bland chicken....Needless to say, it was pretty gross...The worst part is that my waiter saw me tilt the whole plate into my glass to drain the water and didn't even bother coming over to see what the problem was.. As a matter of fact, he didn't come back even once to check on us, or ask how the food was.  We only saw him when he dropped the bill off. Even then, he said nothing as he took away our plates full of uneaten food (my friend had the cashew chicken wich was equally as bad). Once again, I probably should've taken more of an effort to express how much I disliked my dish, but why? I won't allow myself to be talked back into trying Leng again...",36,1.0,/user_details?userid=pg6_s1dliuYRB4SGT45jyQ,Lena L.

Their seasonal specials are always inspiring and fun to try. I love their pork hocks - they are crispy outside and tender and juicy inside. Little things accompanied with this dish - steamed bun and pickled veggies - are also very good. I am a regular fan of their Thai salad - it is a huge portion, but it is always very fresh. Their soups are pretty good as well. Many people recommend massaman curry, so this is the next one I am going to try. I like their presentation as well - their seasonal desert, sweet sticky rice with slice mango, has the most adorable presentation on a plate. They created a heart-shaped rice, which was topped with creamy coconut sauce. It made me smile as soon as I saw the plate and the taste gave me even bigger smile. The mango was perfectly ripe, and portion and taste of sticky rice was perfection.  They created a happy harmony.  Another reason why I come back to this restaurant is their services - the waiters are always alert, friendly, and very warm. Somehow, they remember me and small conversation I had with them.  So it's aways nice to come by. I feel like I can experience warm hospitality that is a charm of Thai culture whenever I am here.
